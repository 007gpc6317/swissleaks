# Digital Tools and Legal Procedures for Human Rights Documentation

The landscape of human rights documentation has been transformed by digital tools that ensure evidence authenticity while protecting victims and advocates. This comprehensive guide provides immediate access to essential resources, from mobile apps that preserve chain of custody to detailed procedures for international legal mechanisms.

## Critical digital documentation tools beyond eyeWitness

While eyeWitness to Atrocities remains a cornerstone tool with its court-tested metadata preservation and secure server storage, several other applications offer unique capabilities for different documentation needs. **Tella** stands out for high-risk environments with its app camouflage features and AES-256 encryption, allowing users to hide the app icon and name while maintaining full offline functionality. The app integrates seamlessly with Uwazi databases and includes a quick-delete function for emergency situations.

**ProofMode** by Guardian Project takes a different approach, working silently in the background with existing camera apps to add cryptographic signatures and SHA256 hashes to every photo or video. This OpenPGP-based system creates tamper-proof evidence without requiring users to learn new interfaces. The app now supports the C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authentication) standard, enhancing its legal credibility.

For protecting witness identities, **ObscuraCam** provides automatic face detection and multiple privacy modes including pixelation, blur, and complete removal. The tool strips all EXIF metadata including GPS coordinates and device information, essential for protecting both subjects and photographers in sensitive situations.

**The Digital Evidence Vault (DEV)** addresses social media evidence preservation, automatically collecting content from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and virtually any internet service while maintaining metadata crucial for legal proceedings. Used by hundreds of researchers since 2013, DEV was specifically designed for court admissibility and tribunal use.

### Mobile forensics and secure communication

**Autopsy Digital Forensics Platform** leads the open-source forensics field, offering hard drive analysis, email forensics, and timeline reconstruction with built-in chain of custody features. The tool is completely free and used by law enforcement worldwide, with extensive training resources available through the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers.

For secure communications, **Signal** remains the gold standard with its end-to-end encryption, disappearing messages, and metadata protection through sealed sender technology. The app now supports usernames to hide phone numbers and group chats up to 1,000 participants. **Tor Browser** provides anonymous web browsing essential for circumventing censorship, while **SecureDrop** enables whistleblower submissions to news organizations through Tor-based anonymous communication.

### Emerging tools for evidence authentication

The rise of deepfakes has made evidence authentication critical. **Intel FakeCatcher** achieves 96% accuracy in real-time deepfake detection by analyzing blood flow signals through photoplethysmography. **Microsoft Video Authenticator** provides confidence scores for media manipulation detection, while **WeVerify** offers collaborative verification through expert networks.

## European Court of Human Rights application procedures

The ECHR has implemented significant changes that affect all applicants. **The deadline for applications is now 4 months, reduced from the previous 6-month period**, effective for all final domestic decisions issued after February 1, 2022. This change, implemented through Protocol No. 15, makes timely action even more critical.

Applications must be submitted **exclusively by post** to: The Registrar, European Court of Human Rights, Council of Europe, 1 avenue de l'Europe, 67075 Strasbourg Cedex, FRANCE. Fax submissions do not interrupt the time limit and must still be followed by postal submission. The Court provides application forms in multiple languages including Albanian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, and all major European languages, though English and French remain the official authentic versions.

The application process requires meticulous completion of the official form with Adobe Reader 9 or higher on Windows or Mac OS X systems. All fields must be filled precisely, and the application must comply with Rule 47 of the Rules of Court. For multiple applicants exceeding 10 persons, a table with identifying details for each applicant must be provided.

**Interim measures under Rule 39** are available for cases involving imminent risk of irreparable harm, typically genuine threats to life and limb. These requests undergo rigorous examination and must not be submitted via the contact form. The Court operates an electronic communication system (eComms) but only after the case communication stage. Initial applications and all supporting documents must be sent by post.

Contact the Court at +33 (0)3 88 41 20 18 or via fax at +33 (0)3 88 41 27 30. The State of Proceedings Online (SOP) search engine allows applicants to check case status for non-anonymous cases allocated to judicial formations.

## UN human rights mechanisms and procedures

The UN system offers multiple avenues for individual complaints, each with specific requirements and procedures. Understanding these mechanisms enables strategic selection based on the nature of violations and urgency of situations.

### UN Human Rights Committee individual communications

The Human Rights Committee examines complaints under the First Optional Protocol to the ICCPR. Submit communications to **tb-petitions@ohchr.org** with "Human rights complaint" as the subject line, or by post to: Petitions and Inquiries Section, Human Rights Committee, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, United Nations Office at Geneva, 8-14 Avenue de la Paix, 1211 Geneva 10, Switzerland.

The Committee requires signed written complaints (email submissions alone are not accepted), with personal information, chronological facts, evidence of exhausted domestic remedies, and relevant treaty articles cited. While no formal time limit exists, delays exceeding 5 years after exhausting domestic remedies or 3 years after another international procedure may constitute abuse unless justified. The online submission portal streamlines the process, though postal submissions using the printable Word form remain acceptable.

### Committee Against Torture complaints procedure

Individual complaints under Article 22 of the Convention Against Torture follow similar submission procedures through **tb-petitions@ohchr.org** or the Geneva postal address. The Committee prioritizes cases involving risk of irreparable harm and maintains a backlog of approximately 160 pending complaints.

Medical evidence proves crucial for torture cases. Documentation should include detailed accounts of ill-treatment, medical certificates where available, psychological effects documentation, and evidence of reporting to authorities. **Interim measures under Article 114** can prevent deportation or extradition where torture risks exist. The Committee meets twice yearly in May and November, with follow-up procedures monitoring implementation of decisions.

### Working Group on Arbitrary Detention submissions

The Working Group operates uniquely as a non-treaty mechanism with an express mandate for individual complaints. Submit cases using the Model Questionnaire available in English, French, and Spanish to **hrc-wg-ad@un.org** or the Geneva postal address.

The Working Group transmits communications to governments within 60 days, allowing a 60-day response period. In 2022, the Working Group adopted 88 opinions covering 160 persons across 50 countries. **Urgent actions** for cases involving health risks or imminent danger can be sent to **urgent-action@ohchr.org** and may receive responses within 24 hours.

### Special Procedures urgent appeals

The Special Procedures system encompasses 46 thematic mandates and 14 country mandates, providing the broadest coverage without requiring treaty ratification or exhaustion of domestic remedies. Submit through the online portal at **spsubmission.ohchr.org** or for urgent cases to **urgent-action@ohchr.org**.

Key Special Rapporteurs include Torture (sr-torture@ohchr.org), Freedom of Opinion/Expression (sr-freedomopinion@ohchr.org), and Human Rights Defenders (sr-hrdefenders@ohchr.org). Communications can address ongoing violations (urgent appeals), past violations (allegation letters), or legislative concerns. The system can respond within 24 hours for urgent cases, with governments given 30 days for urgent appeals or 60 days for allegation letters to respond.

## Swiss legal aid and victim support systems

Switzerland's cantonal system creates variations in legal aid procedures, though all must comply with Article 29(3) of the Federal Constitution guaranteeing access to justice. Understanding these differences enables effective navigation of available support.

### Legal aid applications by canton

**Zurich** processes applications through district courts, with the Zurich Bar Association offering free legal aid bureaus at Amtshaus Werdplatz, Strassburgstrasse 9, 8004 Zurich. Specialized migration law advice costs CHF 50/hour with services available in German, English, French, Kurdish, Spanish, and Turkish. Eligibility requires income at subsistence level (betreibungsrechtliches Existenzminimum), and approved aid covers court costs and lawyer fees with potential reimbursement within 10 years if financial circumstances improve.

**Geneva** centralizes applications through the Greffe de l'assistance juridique (+41 22 327 63 63), accepting the "Demande d'assistance juridique civile ou administrative" form by post or in person. Applicants must provide three months of financial statements and income documentation. Coverage includes court costs, lawyer fees, expert fees, interpreters, and mediation costs, but excludes fines and opposing party costs. Repayment occurs through up to 60 monthly installments over 5 years if financial situation improves.

**Bern** maintains multiple district courts with specific regional jurisdictions. The canton offers support through the Bern Migration Service at Ostermundigenstrasse 99B, CH-3006 Bern, with customer centers available in English upon request. The University of Bern provides student legal advice services, while municipal integration officers assist with legal questions in multiple languages.

**Basel-Stadt** handles applications through the Civil Court at Bäumleingasse 5, 4052 Basel, covering employment, family law, rental law, and debt enforcement disputes. The GGG Migration Team (+41 61 206 92 22) provides advice in 17 languages, with specialized services for domestic violence cases through the Basel Women's Shelter Foundation.

### Victim support (Opferhilfe) procedures

The Federal Victim Support Act provides comprehensive assistance to persons suffering direct harm to physical, psychological, or sexual integrity from criminal acts in Switzerland. Family members of deceased victims and Swiss residents victimized abroad under certain conditions also qualify.

Emergency assistance includes immediate shelter accommodation, medical costs, security measures, and temporary living expenses. Longer-term support encompasses psychological counseling, legal representation in criminal proceedings, social work support, and financial compensation including reimbursement of lost wages. State compensation becomes available when perpetrators cannot pay, with assistance levels dependent on the victim's financial situation.

Contact the FDFA Helpline at +41 800 24 7 365 (24/7 for Swiss citizens abroad) or local emergency services (Police 117, Medical 144). Each canton operates victim support centers with services in multiple languages and interpreter support for minorities. Victims maintain rights to information about case progress, legal representation, notification of perpetrator release, protection during proceedings, and compensation claims.

### Asylum and migration legal aid

Federal asylum centers provide mandatory legal representation through **Caritas Switzerland** in Western Switzerland and Ticino/Central Switzerland, and **HEKS/EPER** in Eastern Switzerland (Altstätten) and Northwestern Switzerland (Basel). This state-funded representation covers first instance asylum procedures, Dublin appeals, administrative detention appeals, and family reunification applications.

**AsyLex** offers independent legal services through online applications at asylex.ch, with specialized teams for detention cases (detention@asylex.ch) and family reunification. Emergency phone lines serve detained persons, with services available in multiple languages.

HEKS/EPER maintains regional offices including Basel (Pfeffingerstrasse 41, +41 61 264 94 24, bas-basel@bas-basel.ch) with open consultations Monday 9:00-11:30 and Wednesday 14:00-16:30, plus phone consultations Tuesday and Thursday 10:00-12:00. Similar offices operate in Zurich, St. Gallen, Aargau, and Bern.

Appeal deadlines vary critically: Dublin decisions require action within 5-7 working days, standard asylum decisions allow 30 days, while detention orders permit immediate appeals. All deadlines face strict enforcement, making immediate action essential.

## Medical documentation and Istanbul Protocol implementation

The **Istanbul Protocol Manual 2022 edition** represents the definitive standard for documenting torture and ill-treatment. Available free from the UN OHCHR website in all six UN languages, this updated edition triples the original length and incorporates 20 years of implementation experience. Download directly from https://www.ohchr.org/en/publications/policy-and-methodological-publications/istanbul-protocol-manual-effective-0.

### Digital tools for medical evidence

**MediCapt**, developed by Physicians for Human Rights, revolutionizes forensic medical evidence collection for sexual violence cases. This free mobile app for qualified healthcare providers features digital medical intake forms, secure forensic photography with tamper-proof metadata, encrypted cloud storage maintaining chain of custody, and data mapping for pattern analysis. Successfully piloted in Kenya and DRC, MediCapt requires internet connectivity for secure transmission but provides comprehensive documentation capabilities for resource-limited settings.

The **Global Psychotrauma Screen (GPS)** offers brief screening in over 25 languages, while specialized instruments like the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 provide validated cross-cultural trauma assessment. For PTSD evaluation, the PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist) and CAPS-5 (Clinician Administered PTSD Scale) remain gold standards, with many instruments available in the public domain.

### Training opportunities for medical professionals

**Physicians for Human Rights** conducts comprehensive Istanbul Protocol training through in-person, virtual, and hybrid formats. Their PHR Asylum Network provides certification for forensic evaluation, with programs in multiple US cities and internationally. Training often comes free for qualified participants, focusing on the 2022 Istanbul Protocol standards.

The **International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT)** maintains 172 member centers across 78 countries, offering training through their Fabo e-learning platform. The Global Standards for Rehabilitation course includes 17 modules with video content from over 40 member organizations in multiple languages.

The **Asylum Medicine Training Initiative (AMTI)** provides free online courses with peer-reviewed content based on Istanbul Protocol 2022, targeting healthcare providers at all levels. For hands-on experience, the Weill Cornell Center for Human Rights operates a medical student-run clinic conducting torture survivor asylum evaluations in partnership with PHR.

### Case management and secure collaboration platforms

**Uwazi** by HURIDOCS emerges as the premier free, open-source platform specifically designed for human rights documentation. Features include document and media relationship mapping, machine learning for automated classification, integration with Tella mobile app, and support for right-to-left languages including Arabic. HURIDOCS provides training and support for implementation.

For encrypted collaboration, **CryptPad** offers end-to-end encryption with real-time collaboration and zero-knowledge architecture. The platform requires no registration for guests and is actively used by human rights organizations including SEDEM. Free tier includes 1GB storage with paid plans for additional space.

Organizations requiring comprehensive case management might consider **Salesforce Nonprofit Cloud**, offering 10 free licenses through the Power of Us Program with enterprise-grade security and extensive training through the Trailhead platform. For purely open-source solutions, **CiviCase** provides case tracking, client relationship management, and workflow automation as part of the CiviCRM ecosystem.

## Implementation recommendations and next steps

Success in human rights documentation requires matching tools to specific contexts and threat levels. Organizations operating in high-risk environments should prioritize tools with offline capabilities like Tella and evidence preservation systems like eyeWitness. Those focusing on legal proceedings need platforms designed for chain of custody like MediCapt and Digital Evidence Vault.

Training remains essential across all tools and procedures. The strict deadlines for ECHR (4 months) and Swiss Dublin procedures (5-7 days) demand immediate action and thorough preparation. UN mechanisms offer more flexibility but require strategic selection based on state obligations and urgency levels.

For medical documentation, combining the Istanbul Protocol 2022 standards with digital tools like MediCapt and validated psychological assessment instruments ensures comprehensive, court-admissible evidence. Regular training through PHR or IRCT strengthens documentation quality and legal outcomes.

Security considerations must guide every implementation decision. End-to-end encryption, secure communication channels, and proper operational security training protect both victims and advocates. Regular updates, security audits, and threat model assessments ensure continued protection as risks evolve.

This comprehensive toolkit empowers human rights defenders with immediately actionable resources. By combining secure documentation tools, clear legal procedures, and professional medical standards, organizations can build compelling cases that withstand legal scrutiny while protecting those who courageously document violations. The key lies in selecting appropriate tools for specific contexts, maintaining rigorous security practices, and acting swiftly within legal deadlines to ensure justice for victims of human rights violations.
